# Schelling Model
Thomas Schelling (1971) created an agent based model using checker boards to 
simulate the creation of segregated neighborhoods, in a society where no individual 
necessarily has a strong preference for segregation.  To see a simulation with a visual 
component, visit the bottom of this page: http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/
The following code will replicate his model in Python.  
We will not create a visual component in this class, though it is well within 
Python's abilities to do so.  We will use the following guidelines:

1. At least two kinds of agents
2. Each agent needs a preference for similar neighbors
3. Each agent gets to move around if preference not met


The World class has been made for you, take a look and try to understand how it works
Your task is to write a function for Agents
